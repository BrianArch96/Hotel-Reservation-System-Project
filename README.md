# Hotel-Reservation-System-Project
Small reservation system project implemented in java
There will be three types of users for the system: supervisors, hotel desk personnel and
customers. A customer will be able to make reservations and cancellations. A hotel desk
administrator will also be able to make reservations and cancellations for a customer.
They will also be able to handle check-in and check-out services. A supervisor will be
able to do all the things that a hotel desk administrator can do but may also be able to
apply discounts to bookings. 
Csv files are used to store data with relation to the Hotel Reservation System.
